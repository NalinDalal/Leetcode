/*1717. Maximum Score From Removing Substrings
You are given a string s and two integers x and y. You can perform two types of operations any number of times.

Remove substring "ab" and gain x points.
For example, when removing "ab" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cxbae".
Remove substring "ba" and gain y points.
For example, when removing "ba" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cabxe".
Return the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "cdbcbbaaabab", x = 4, y = 5
Output: 19
Explanation:
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaaabab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaaab" and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ab" underlined in "cdbcbbaaab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaa" and 4 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaa". Now, s = "cdbcba" and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcba". Now, s = "cdbc" and 5 points are added to the score.
Total score = 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 19.
Example 2:

Input: s = "aabbaaxybbaabb", x = 5, y = 4
Output: 20
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
1 <= x, y <= 104
s consists of lowercase English letters.

Hint 1
Note that it is always more optimal to take one type of substring before another
Hint 2
You can use a stack to handle erasures

/*Approach
given string `s`, 2 int `x`,`y`
- Remove `"ab"` â†’ gain `x` points
- Remove `"ba"` â†’ gain `y` points

remove substrings in an order that gives maximum total score.

1. decide which subStr to remove 1st based on `x`,`y`
2. Use a stack to simulate removing substrings efficiently:
    - If removing `"ab"` first:
        - Traverse from left to right, use a stack.
        - If top is `'a'` and current is `'b'`, pop and gain `x` points.

    - If removing `"ba"` first:
        - Traverse from left to right.
        - If top is `'b'` and current is `'a'`, pop and gain `y` points.

3. After first pass, process the remaining string to remove the other substring.
