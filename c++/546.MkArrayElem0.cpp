/*3354. Make Array Elements Equal to Zero
You are given an integer array nums.

Start by selecting a starting position curr such that nums[curr] == 0, and
choose a movement direction of either left or right.

After that, you repeat the following process:

If curr is out of the range [0, n - 1], this process ends.
If nums[curr] == 0, move in the current direction by incrementing curr if you
are moving right, or decrementing curr if you are moving left. Else if
nums[curr] > 0: Decrement nums[curr] by 1. Reverse your movement direction (left
becomes right and vice versa). Take a step in your new direction. A selection of
the initial position curr and movement direction is considered valid if every
element in nums becomes 0 by the end of the process.

Return the number of possible valid selections.



Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,0,2,0,3]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The only possible valid selections are the following:
Choose curr = 3, and a movement direction to the left.
[1,0,2,0,3] -> [1,0,2,0,3] -> [1,0,1,0,3] -> [1,0,1,0,3] -> [1,0,1,0,2] ->
[1,0,1,0,2] -> [1,0,0,0,2] -> [1,0,0,0,2] -> [1,0,0,0,1] -> [1,0,0,0,1] ->
[1,0,0,0,1] -> [1,0,0,0,1] -> [0,0,0,0,1] -> [0,0,0,0,1] -> [0,0,0,0,1] ->
[0,0,0,0,1] -> [0,0,0,0,0]. Choose curr = 3, and a movement direction to the
right. [1,0,2,0,3] -> [1,0,2,0,3] -> [1,0,2,0,2] -> [1,0,2,0,2] -> [1,0,1,0,2]
-> [1,0,1,0,2] -> [1,0,1,0,1] -> [1,0,1,0,1] -> [1,0,0,0,1] -> [1,0,0,0,1] ->
[1,0,0,0,0] -> [1,0,0,0,0] -> [1,0,0,0,0] -> [1,0,0,0,0] -> [0,0,0,0,0].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,3,4,0,4,1,0]
Output: 0
Explanation:
There are no possible valid selections.



Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 100
There is at least one element i where nums[i] == 0.
*/

/*1. for each index `i` where `nums[i]==0`, simulate twice: `left`,`right`
 2. Simulation:
    - Make a copy of nums (since it mutates).
    - Follow the process until curr goes out of bounds.
    - If, at the end, all elements in the copy are 0 â†’ it's a valid selection.
3. Count all valid cases.
