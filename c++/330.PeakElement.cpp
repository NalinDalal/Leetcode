/*162. Find Peak Element
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is
always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the
array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.



Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index
number 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak
element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i. */

class Solution {
public:
  int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
    // return i such that nums[i]>nums[i-1] and nums[i]>nums[i+1]
    // just find max in vector, return it's index
    if (nums.empty())
      return -1; // Handle empty vector case

    int maxIndex = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
      if (nums[i] > nums[maxIndex]) {
        maxIndex = i;
      }
    }
    return maxIndex;
  }
