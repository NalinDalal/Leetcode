2493. Divide Nodes Into the Maximum Number of Groups

You are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes in an
undirected graph. The nodes are labeled from 1 to n.

You are also given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates
that there is a bidirectional edge between nodes ai and bi. Notice that the
given graph may be disconnected.

Divide the nodes of the graph into m groups (1-indexed) such that:

Each node in the graph belongs to exactly one group.
For every pair of nodes in the graph that are connected by an edge [ai, bi], if
ai belongs to the group with index x, and bi belongs to the group with index y,
then |y - x| = 1. Return the maximum number of groups (i.e., maximum m) into
which you can divide the nodes. Return -1 if it is impossible to group the nodes
with the given conditions.



Example 1:
Input: n = 6, edges = [[1,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,6],[2,3],[4,6]]
Output: 4
Explanation: As shown in the image we:
- Add node 5 to the first group.
- Add node 1 to the second group.
- Add nodes 2 and 4 to the third group.
- Add nodes 3 and 6 to the fourth group.
We can see that every edge is satisfied.
It can be shown that that if we create a fifth group and move any node from the
third or fourth group to it, at least on of the edges will not be satisfied.

Example 2:
Input: n = 3, edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: If we add node 1 to the first group, node 2 to the second group,
and node 3 to the third group to satisfy the first two edges, we can see that
the third edge will not be satisfied. It can be shown that no grouping is
possible.


Constraints:
1 <= n <= 500
1 <= edges.length <= 104
edges[i].length == 2
1 <= ai, bi <= n
ai != bi
There is at most one edge between any pair of vertices.

// Intuition:
// Check if the graph is bipartite to see if a valid split exists.
// For each connected part of the graph, find the largest number of groups we
// can divide the nodes into and return their sum.

// Approach
/* Algorithm
isBipartite(adjList, node, colors) function
- Iterate over the neighbors of node and attempt to assign them the opposite
color of node:
    - If neighbor already has the same color as node (i.e., colors[neighbor] ==
colors[node]), return false.
    - If neighbor has already been assigned a color (i.e., colors[neighbor] !=
-1), skip to the next neighbor.
    - Assign colors[neighbor] = (colors[node] + 1) % 2.
    - Recursively call isBipartite(adjList, neighbor, colors) and return false
if the call returns false.
- If all neighbors are successfully assigned the opposite color without
conflicts, return true.

getLongestShortestPath(adjList, srcNode, n) function
- Initialize a queue, nodesQueue and a visited array of size n.
- PushsrcNode into the queue and mark it as visited.
- Initialize distance to 0.
- While the nodesQueue is not empty:
    - Initialize numOfNodesInLayer to the size of the queue.
    - Process all nodes in the current layer, i.e. for i from 0 to
numOfNodesInLayer - 1:
        - Pop out the first element from the queue as currentNode.
        - For each neighbor of currentNode:
        - If the neighbor is visited, skip it.
        - Otherwise, mark it as visited and push it into the nodesQueue.
    - Increment distance by 1.
- Return distance.

getNumberOfGroupsForComponent(adjList, node, distances, visited) function
- Initialize maxNumberOfGroups to distances[node].
- Mark the current node as visited.
- Explore the rest of the nodes in the component, i.e. for each neighbor of
node:
    - If the neighbor is visited, skip it.
    - Otherwise, set maxNumberOfGroups to the maximum of its current value and
getNumberOfComponentsInGroup(adjList, neighbor, distances, visited).
- Return maxNumberOfGroups.

In the main magnificentSets(n, edges) function:
- Create the adjList of the graph.
- Create a colors array of size n with all elements initially set to -1.
- For each node of the graph:
    - If the node have not been assigned a color, i.e. (colors[node] == -1):
    - Fix the color of the first node of the component, i.e. set colors[node] =
0.
    - Call isBipartite(adjList, node, colors) to determine if the current
component is bipartite. If not, return -1.
- Initialize an array distances to store the length of the longest shortest path
from any node to any other.
- Fill the distances array using the getLongestShortestPath function.
- Initialize maxNumberOfGroups to 0 and a visited array with all elements set to
false.
- For each node of the graph:
    - If node has not been visited:
        - Get the number of groups for its component and add it to the total
number of groups, i.e. maxNumberOfGroups +=
getNumberOfGroupsForComponent(adjList, node, distances, visited).
- Return maxNumberOfGroups.
