/* 2200. Find All K-Distant Indices in an Array

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and two integers key and k. A
k-distant index is an index i of nums for which there exists at least one index
j such that |i - j| <= k and nums[j] == key.

Return a list of all k-distant indices sorted in increasing order.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,9,1,3,9,5], key = 9, k = 1
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Explanation: Here, nums[2] == key and nums[5] == key.
- For index 0, |0 - 2| > k and |0 - 5| > k, so there is no j where |0 - j| <= k
and nums[j] == key. Thus, 0 is not a k-distant index.
- For index 1, |1 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 1 is a k-distant index.
- For index 2, |2 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 2 is a k-distant index.
- For index 3, |3 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 3 is a k-distant index.
- For index 4, |4 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 4 is a k-distant index.
- For index 5, |5 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 5 is a k-distant index.
- For index 6, |6 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 6 is a k-distant index.
Thus, we return [1,2,3,4,5,6] which is sorted in increasing order.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], key = 2, k = 2
Output: [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation: For all indices i in nums, there exists some index j such that |i -
j| <= k and nums[j] == key, so every index is a k-distant index. Hence, we
return [0,1,2,3,4].


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
key is an integer from the array nums.
1 <= k <= nums.length

Hint 1
For every occurrence of key in nums, find all indices within distance k from it.
Hint 2
Use a hash table to remove duplicate indices.
*/
/* Approach
1. Find all indices where nums[i] == key.

2. For each such index, add all indices in the range [i-k, i+k] to a result set,
as long as theyâ€™re within bounds.

3. Use a set to avoid duplicate entries.

4. Finally, convert the set to a vector, sort it, and return.
