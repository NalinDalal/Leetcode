/*3333. Find the Original Typed String II
Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she
tends to be clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a character
being typed multiple times.

You are given a string word, which represents the final output displayed on
Alice's screen. You are also given a positive integer k.

Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have
intended to type, if she was trying to type a string of size at least k.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.



Example 1:

Input: word = "aabbccdd", k = 7

Output: 5

Explanation:

The possible strings are: "aabbccdd", "aabbccd", "aabbcdd", "aabccdd", and
"abbccdd".

Example 2:

Input: word = "aabbccdd", k = 8

Output: 1

Explanation:

The only possible string is "aabbccdd".

Example 3:

Input: word = "aaabbb", k = 3

Output: 8



Constraints:

1 <= word.length <= 5 * 105
word consists only of lowercase English letters.
1 <= k <= 2000

Hint 1
Instead of solving for at least k, can we solve for at most k - 1 length?
*/

/*Intuition:
- Typing the original string (with potential long key presses) resulted in the
final string word

- The original string length is at least k

- A character in the original string can be repeated one or more times in word
due to long key presses

- For every group of consecutive same characters in word, Alice must have typed
it at least once, and at most as many times as appear in word.

- So for a group like "aaa" â†’ Alice could've intended to type "a", "aa", or
"aaa".
*/

/* Solution:
- Use KnapSack
- let `groupLens` be the array of counts of each character group.
- Let `dp[i]` be the number of ways to make a total intended length of `i`.
- Count all combinations of choosing x_i from [1 ... groupLens[i]] for each
group, such that:
```cpp
sum(x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_N) >= k
```

## DP
- dp[0] = 1 (base case: one way to form length 0)

- For each group length cnt, update dp as:

For each `total = MAX ... 0`:
```cpp
dp[total + i] += dp[total] for i in [1..cnt]
```

This can be done efficiently with prefix sums (or sliding window).
