/*3494. Find the Minimum Amount of Time to Brew Potions
You are given two integer arrays, skill and mana, of length n and m,
respectively.

In a laboratory, n wizards must brew m potions in order. Each potion has a mana
capacity mana[j] and must pass through all the wizards sequentially to be brewed
properly. The time taken by the ith wizard on the jth potion is timeij =
skill[i] * mana[j].

Since the brewing process is delicate, a potion must be passed to the next
wizard immediately after the current wizard completes their work. This means the
timing must be synchronized so that each wizard begins working on a potion
exactly when it arrives. â€‹

Return the minimum amount of time required for the potions to be brewed
properly.



Example 1:
Input: skill = [1,5,2,4], mana = [5,1,4,2]
Output: 110

Explanation:
Potion Number	Start time	Wizard 0 done by	Wizard 1 done by
Wizard 2 done by	Wizard 3 done by 0	0	5	30	40
60 1	52	53	58	60	64 2	54	58	78	86
102 3	86	88	98	102	110 As an example for why wizard 0
cannot start working on the 1st potion before time t = 52, consider the case
where the wizards started preparing the 1st potion at time t = 50. At time t =
58, wizard 2 is done with the 1st potion, but wizard 3 will still be working on
the 0th potion till time t = 60.

Example 2:
Input: skill = [1,1,1], mana = [1,1,1]
Output: 5

Explanation:
Preparation of the 0th potion begins at time t = 0, and is completed by time t
= 3. Preparation of the 1st potion begins at time t = 1, and is completed by
time t = 4. Preparation of the 2nd potion begins at time t = 2, and is completed
by time t = 5.

Example 3:
Input: skill = [1,2,3,4], mana = [1,2]
Output: 21



Constraints:

n == skill.length
m == mana.length
1 <= n, m <= 5000
1 <= mana[i], skill[i] <= 5000



Hint 1
Maintain each wizard's earliest free time (for the last potion) as f[i].
Hint 2
Let x be the current mana value. Starting from now = f[0], update now = max(now
+ skill[i - 1] * x, f[i]) for i in [1..n]. Then, the final f[n - 1] = now +
skill[n - 1] * x for this potion. Hint 3 Update all other f values by f[i] = f[i
+ 1] - skill[i + 1] * x for i in [0..n - 2] (in reverse order).
